        Create a PipelineLogger object. The intention is that one object of this type should be created at the beginning of a script or thread with specific settings, and is then passed to all functions that might need to log output.
        
        Parameters:
        out (output stream) = Where log messages will be written to. Can be a file in write-mode. Defaults to STDERR.
        dbg (bool) = Should debug-level messages be written to this log? Defaults to True.
        strict (bool) = Should warning messages be treated as errors?
        autoflush (bool) = Should every message also be followed by a flush() call on the output stream? (Useful for long-running scripts)
